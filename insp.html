            <h1>The Boy Who Painted the Sky</h1>

            <p>In the dry, sun-scorched town of Bharsana, colors were a luxury. The walls were gray, the fields brown, and the sky—always a pale, faded blue. Rain had not touched the earth in seven years, and hope dried up quicker than the village wells.</p>
            <p>Yet in a dusty corner of the village lived a boy named Aman, with paint-stained hands and eyes that saw the world not as it was, but as it could be.</p>
            <p>Aman’s father was a potter, his mother a washerwoman. They could barely afford food, let alone paint, but Aman would collect flower petals, grind spices, crush berries—anything that could give him color. On ruined walls and cracked pottery, he painted birds, rivers, and trees that hadn’t been seen in years.</p>
            <p>“Why waste time?” the villagers scoffed. “You can’t paint water into a well.”</p>
            <p>But Aman painted anyway.</p>
            <p>One day, he found a broken school wall facing the main street. It was bare and peeling. Aman decided to paint a sky—not the dull one above, but a sky bursting with color, filled with rain, stars, clouds, and light. He worked day after day, scraping together color from wherever he could, borrowing chalk from the school and water from the temple to mix his pigments.</p>
            <p>Children began to gather. Even adults slowed their steps, curious. “Will it bring real rain?” a boy once asked.</p>
            <p>“No,” Aman said, smiling. “But it will remind you what it looks like.”</p>
            <p>When the mural was finished, something strange happened. People began repainting their homes. Pots once left plain now held patterns. Shopkeepers strung marigold garlands on their doors. Women drew rangoli again, not for festivals, but for the joy of it.</p>
            <p>Soon, a journalist passing through the village photographed Aman’s mural. The image went viral—"The Boy Who Painted Hope." Art foundations and NGOs arrived. Donations poured in. A rain-harvesting project was launched. New wells were dug. Saplings were planted.</p>
            <p>And one morning, as Aman stood looking at his now-famous mural, a drop hit his cheek. Then another. Then the sky cracked open—and for the first time in seven years, it rained.</p>
            <p>The village danced.</p>
            <p>But Aman only smiled, his paints in hand. “The sky was always waiting,” he said. “We just had to remember it was ours to color.”</p>
