            <p>Long ago, before the stars learned to twinkle, there was a village nestled between the Silverwood Forest and a still, glassy lake called Lira. The villagers lived quiet lives, growing herbs, spinning yarn, and whispering to the wind. But every night, they gathered around the lake, for in its waters shimmered something rare — the reflection of the Moon herself.</p>
            <p>The Moon was no ordinary moon. She sang lullabies that could calm a crying baby, and her silver light healed the cracks in worn-out shoes and hearts alike. The villagers believed she watched over them — a quiet guardian of the night.</p>
            <p>Then one night, something strange happened.</p>
            <p>There was a shudder in the air. The wind held its breath. And as the villagers stared into the lake, they saw not a reflection — but the Moon herself, fallen from the sky, floating upon the water like a silver blossom.</p>
            <p>The lake rippled with magic, and from the shore, a little girl named Luma stepped forward. She was the candle-maker's daughter, known for dreaming with her eyes open. Her name meant “light,” and perhaps it was fate that the Moon had fallen on her birthday.</p>
            <p>Without hesitation, Luma waded into the water, her feet not sinking but dancing atop the surface. As she reached the Moon, she whispered, “Why have you fallen?”</p>
            <p>The Moon opened one pale eye. “I'm tired,” she said, her voice like the chime of distant bells. “For centuries, I've watched. I've given and glowed. But no one remembers why I shine. They no longer look up. They sleep under electric skies. I feel... forgotten.”</p>
            <p>Luma sat beside her, legs folded, her small hands gently touching the Moon's edge. “Maybe they forgot,” she said softly, “but I didn't. I light candles in your honor. I tell stories about you. Sometimes, I even try to sing your songs.”</p>
            <p>The Moon sighed. “You are only one.”</p>
            <p>“But one is enough to start again,” Luma said.</p>
            <p>That night, Luma stayed beside the Moon, telling her every story she knew. The Moon laughed when Luma told of a rooster who tried to chase away shadows. She sighed when Luma whispered of a widow who lit a candle every night hoping her sailor husband would return.</p>
            <p>By dawn, something had changed. The lake, once still, now pulsed with gentle waves. The Moon looked younger. Her silvery light grew stronger, reflecting not just Luma, but every sleeping dream in the village.</p>
            <p>The next evening, Luma gathered the villagers by the lake. They brought music, lanterns, painted stones, and poems. One by one, they spoke to the Moon—not in prayers, but in gratitude.</p>
            <p>“Thank you for lighting my path,” said the baker, who once lost his way during a storm.</p>
            <p>“Thank you for hearing my lullabies,” whispered the seamstress, whose child had passed.</p>
            <p>“Thank you,” said the village elder, “for keeping the night beautiful.”</p>
            <p>The Moon glowed brighter with each word. Her light lifted the mist from the water. Flowers bloomed on the lake's edge that had never bloomed before. Fireflies danced to her rhythm.</p>
            <p>Then came the stars.</p>
            <p>They blinked on, one by one, like curious eyes waking from sleep. The Moon lifted from the lake, rising slowly, her sadness shed like a worn cloak. The villagers gasped as moonlight spilled over their faces, painting them in silver and serenity.</p>
            <p>Before she disappeared into the sky, she spoke one last time to Luma:</p>
            <p>“You reminded them. You reminded me. Light isn't meant to be admired. It's meant to be shared.”</p>
            <p>From that day on, the lake of Lira glowed every night — not just with the Moon's reflection, but with floating candles that the villagers released, filled with wishes, stories, and songs.</p>
            <p>Luma grew up to become the Keeper of Light, writing stories that reached beyond the village, across mountains, oceans, and even into cities where electric skies had dulled the stars.</p>
            <p>And high above, the Moon never forgot the girl who helped her rise again — the child who believed that even a single voice could awaken the sky.</p>
