            <h1>The Postbox at the End of the World</h1>

            <p>There was a cliff at the northernmost edge of the world, where snow whispered secrets and winds howled like forgotten memories. And at the very edge of that cliff stood a single, rusting postbox—red, old, and crooked with time.</p>
            <p>Locals called it “The Postbox at the End of the World.” No one remembered who built it, or why it was there. But the legend was clear: write a letter to someone you’ve lost, and the wind would deliver it—wherever they may be.</p>
            <p>It sounded foolish. Childish. Magical.</p>
            <p>And yet, people came.</p>
            <p>A little boy left a drawing for his dog, Momo. An old man left a poem for the wife he had loved every day for sixty years. A woman left a song for her baby who never got to take his first breath.</p>
            <p>The box never overflowed. Letters vanished, quietly. As if the wind swallowed them up and scattered them across time and space.</p>
            <p>One snowy morning, a girl named Mira trudged up the path alone. She wore a green coat, too big for her shoulders, and clutched a crumpled paper in her hand.</p>
            <p>It had been a year since her brother Aarav’s plane had gone missing over the ocean. No wreckage, no survivors. Only silence. She had stopped talking after that. Even therapy hadn’t helped. But then she heard about the postbox.</p>
            <p>She didn’t believe in magic. But grief makes you try strange things.</p>
            <p>Mira reached the cliff, heart pounding, and stared at the weathered postbox. It looked like it might fall apart with a sneeze. The wind howled, biting her face.</p>
            <p>She unfolded her letter and read it aloud, voice trembling.</p>
            <p>“Hi Aarav. I know you’re gone. But I still wait every night for a call. I miss our jokes. I miss your bad guitar. I miss how you always took the burnt toast and left the good ones for me.”</p>
            <p>Her fingers shook as she slid the letter in.</p>
            <p>“If this wind really goes where you are… tell him I said I’m okay. Even if it’s a lie.”</p>
            <p>She let go.</p>
            <p>The letter disappeared into the slot—and for a moment, the wind softened. It curled around her like a hug. Mira swore she heard a voice: faint, warm, familiar.</p>
            <p><em>“Burnt toast was my thing, remember?”</em></p>
            <p>She looked around. No one. Just sky and snow. But for the first time in a year, she smiled.</p>
            <p>From that day, she began writing a letter each week. Some were angry, some were funny, some were full of nonsense. The postbox took them all. And each time, she felt lighter.</p>
            <p>One day, Mira returned with a backpack full of letters. But this time, she wasn’t alone. A group of people stood silently by the postbox—young, old, strangers—each holding something precious.</p>
            <p>They had read her blog. “Letters to Nowhere,” she had called it. And now they came with letters of their own.</p>
            <p>For mothers, for sons, for best friends, for pets, for futures that never came.</p>
            <p>The postbox never broke. Never judged. It simply stood at the end of the world, swallowing sorrows and releasing hearts.</p>
            <p>Years later, Mira became the caretaker of the trail leading to the cliff. She painted the postbox every spring. Red, always red.</p>
            <p>People still asked: “Where do the letters go?”</p>
            <p>She would smile and say, “Wherever they need to.”</p>
            <p>And in the wind, sometimes—just sometimes—you might hear laughter, or music, or a line from an old conversation you thought you had forgotten.</p>
            <p>The postbox didn’t bring people back. But it brought pieces of them forward.</p>
            <p>And that, Mira believed, was its magic.</p>
