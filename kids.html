            <h1>The Day the Zoo Went on Strike</h1>

            <p>At the edge of the bustling city stood Maplewood Zoo, a cozy place full of giggles, camera clicks, and the occasional flying popcorn kernel. Children loved it, parents tolerated it, and animals—well, they were getting tired.</p>
            <p>“I’m telling you, Max,” grumbled Greta the giraffe, “I cannot stretch my neck one more time for these selfies.”</p>
            <p>Max the monkey swung down from a tree. “Yesterday a boy tried to feed me a banana peel. Just the peel! What kind of insult is that?”</p>
            <p>“They banged on my glass again,” sighed Terry the turtle. “I’m already slow. Do I need trauma too?”</p>
            <p>The animals gathered under the old fig tree by the lion enclosure. Leo, the lion king himself, stretched lazily and cleared his throat. “Friends, I believe it’s time for change.”</p>
            <p>“Change?” whispered Penny the penguin. “Like a new zookeeper?”</p>
            <p>Leo shook his mane. “No. A strike.”</p>
            <p>The word bounced through the zoo like a rogue beach ball.</p>
            <p>“A STRIKE?” gasped Greta. “You mean we stop doing… animal things?”</p>
            <p>“Exactly,” said Leo. “No roars, no flips, no posing. Just sit still. Let the humans wonder.”</p>
            <p>The idea was wild. Ridiculous. Brilliant.</p>
            <p>By morning, it began.</p>
            <p>Max refused to swing or shriek. Greta tucked her neck like a moody accordion. Terry hid in his shell. Penny waddled backward. Even Leo lay with his back turned to the crowd.</p>
            <p>The visitors were baffled. “Why aren’t the animals doing anything?” a boy whined.</p>
            <p>“Maybe they’re tired,” said his mother.</p>
            <p>By noon, crowds gathered, expecting some dramatic show. Instead, they got silence, slouched animals, and zero entertainment. Panic spread among the zookeepers.</p>
            <p>“Are they sick?” asked Jerry the head keeper.</p>
            <p>“No,” whispered a little girl watching through the rail. “They’re sad.”</p>
            <p>Word traveled fast. A reporter caught wind and wrote: *‘Maplewood Zoo Animals Refuse to Perform. Are They Unhappy?’*</p>
            <p>It went viral.</p>
            <p>That night, under the moonlight, the animals held a second meeting.</p>
            <p>“It’s working,” said Max, nibbling a grape.</p>
            <p>“Tomorrow, we talk,” said Leo.</p>
            <p>The next morning, a large sign hung over the lion’s den. It read in big bold letters:  
            <em>“WE WANT RESPECT, REST, AND BETTER SNACKS.”</em></p>
            <p>Below that, in smaller pawprints:  
            <em>“And no tapping on the glass. Seriously.”</em></p>
            <p>The humans were stunned. Children stared, adults took photos, and the mayor showed up personally.</p>
            <p>By evening, a city meeting was held. “If animals are on strike, what does that say about us?” asked the mayor. “We need to listen.”</p>
            <p>Changes came fast. More green space. Nap hours. Better food. Glass with signs that said “Please do not tap—we’re watching you.”</p>
            <p>The next day, Max did a backflip. Greta lifted her neck proudly. Terry did a slow, heroic crawl. Penny slid down an ice ramp just for fun. Leo roared—a deep, satisfied sound.</p>
            <p>The crowd cheered. But now, they also clapped softly. They waved, whispered, and thanked the animals with smiles, not noise.</p>
            <p>The zoo was never the same.</p>
            <p>Every Sunday, the animals got a “Lazy Day” with hammocks and music. And a statue was built outside the gates: A bronze monkey holding a tiny sign that read:  
            <em>“Even the smallest voice can start the loudest roar.”</em></p>
            <p>And that, dear reader, is how the zoo went on strike… and made the world listen.</p>
